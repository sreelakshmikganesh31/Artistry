#  Artistry – A Creative Space for Artists

Hey there! 
**Artistry** is a web app I designed and built in just a few days as a personal challenge. It's made using **ReactJS (frontend)** and **Django (Python backend)**, and it's all about giving artists a space to **showcase their work**, **connect with others**, and even **sell their art**.

The idea came from platforms like **Instagram and Pinterest**, so I added features like:
- User profiles
- Post sharing
- An interactive and smooth UI

The project is still a **work in progress**, and I’ve got a lot more features planned — like better user interaction, bidding systems, and a full marketplace setup. I started this for fun and learning, and I'm really excited to keep building on it! 

Stay tuned — more updates coming soon.
